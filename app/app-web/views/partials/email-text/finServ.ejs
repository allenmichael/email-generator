<p>I'm currently working with a company to help them improve the customer/advisor experience online and improve document access and I thought you might be interested in seeing what we are architecting for them.   As an example, Raymond James, a Box platform customer, said their portal deployment (to include financial statements via client portal) went from a 2 year project to a 2 month project by using Box.</p>
<p>Using Box's platform as a foundation, we worked to allow for clients, financial advisors, brokers and investors to access personal documents, submit documentation to edit policies/manage investment forms and statements, and execute/sign documents - all from an individual client portal or mobile device.</p>
<p>A project like this takes minimal time from a development standpoint as our platform already has all the core compliance and security features of Box built in.</p>
<p>Do you have some time in the coming weeks to discuss?</p>
